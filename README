Manchester Baby Group 4 Readme

1. Running a program on the Baby

To run a machine code file on the Manchester Baby there are two options:

a) From command line: ./baby filename
b) From a menu: ./baby  (A menu will show prompting you to enter a filename)

2. Assembling a program using the Assembler:

To assemble a file (assembly code -> machine code),
simply call the following from command line: ./assembler filename 

Please be aware of the following issue with the assembler: if the file contains tabs or doesn't have a space at the end of a line there may be an issue reading it.

3. Modifications to the Baby:

Our Manchester Baby has extended the capabilities of the original:

a) It has two addressing modes: 
	i) Absolute (like the original) represented in assembly by "OPCODE MEMORY_ADDRESS"
	ii) Immediate represented in assembly by "OPCODE #VALUE"

	Because of this we extended the operands to be 6-bits long to allow slightly larger values 		to be used with immediate addressing.


b) It can be extended to store 64 32-bit lines in the Store (this can be done from a menu option)

c) It has an extended instruction set:

	This means opcodes are 4-bits instead of 3.
	The extended ones are 0001 to 1011.
	Every operation that takes an operand can also be used with the Immediate Addressing Mode.

	 Instr	 Opcode
	{ JMP	 0000 } Jump
	{ JRP 	 1000 } Jump Relative
	{ LDN 	 0100 } Load Negative
	{ STO 	 1100 } Store
	{ SUB 	 0010 } Subtract
	{ SUB 	 1010 } Subtract
	{ CMP 	 0110 } Compare
	{ STP 	 1110 } Stop
	{ MUL 	 0001 } Multiply
	{ LDP 	 1001 } Load Positive
	{ ADD 	 0101 } Add
	{ NEGSTO 1101 }	Store Negative
	{ INC	 0011 }	Increment
	{ DEC	 1011 }	Deincrement
